                <p class="text-muted">
                    Victor has over 7 years of concert and event lighting experience, and has worked tours for bands such as They Might Be Giants, Grouplove, Manchester Orchestra, The Kooks and The Horrors. Victor decided to start Squeek Lights after dealing with the lack of lighting rental options that worked within some of his client's budgets. As the owner of Squeek Lights, Victor is committed to providing great musicians with technical, emotion-driven lighting that enhance the concert experience. Contact Victor directly at <a href="mailto:victor@squeeklights.com">victor@squeeklights.com</a> for more details on rental packages and light design services.
