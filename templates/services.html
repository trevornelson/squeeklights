                    <p class="text-muted">Squeek Lights delivers impactful lighting, created to complement the music and enhance the crowd’s energy.  The goal is consistent, but the path varies based on clients' needs and budget.  In an ideal world, we create the design, program the tour in advance and deliver a polished product that is ready to go for your first show. On the road, we adapt the show to fit each venue, integrating the house lighting rig into the design, which creates a full, unified look. We love doing this.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Many tours don’t have that extra bunk free, but want everything that lighting brings to the show.  In this situation we design an easy to set up rig, train an existing member of the band’s crew how to run it, and teach the tricks for adapting the show on the run.  Without needing an additional tech on the road, you can give your audience an enhanced experience.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Squeek Lights is a proud user of Chauvet Professional lighting equipment and is an authorized dealer, please contact us for pricing.</p>
